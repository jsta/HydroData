Las Animas County 628FcD: only 3 interpretations changed due to calulating LEP, AASHTO group, changing EC and SAR from 0 to 0.1, and populating ESP and pH chloride.

El Paso County 625086: updating LL, PI, AASHTO group, LEP using calculations affected 12 interpretations. Additional changes occured by populating ESP, pH chloride, and changing EC from 0 to 0.1.

This map unit is found in northeastern Las Animas County and southern El Paso County in the higher elevations of MLRA 69B. Fort soils are very deep well drained and formed on hills and interfluves of low to moderate relief. The surface is typically sandy loam and the argillic horizon is typically clay loam or sandy clay loam and is leached of carbonates in the upper part of the argillic horizon. The calcic horizon is usually below the argillic but may be included within the Btk horizon. Included in this map unit are Kimera, Vonid, and Wilid soils. Kimera soils lack argillic horizons and are on the shoulders of hills and rigdes. Vonid soils formed in thick eolian deposits on hills and ridges and have an argillic horizon that is typically sandy loam.  Wilid soils formed in deeper loess and fine eolian deposits on interfluves. Additional inclusions in the original published soil surveys are Keith in El Paso County and Chicosa in Las Animas County. Keith soils are presently not correlated in MLRA 69B. Chicosa soils have only been correlated in Las Animas County.
