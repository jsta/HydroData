Amendment to:

Classification and Correlation 
of the Soils of
El Paso County, Colorado

These changes are being incorporated to the non-MLRA soil survey areas as part of the SDJR initiative.

National map unit 2qnmq representing Wilid silt loam, 0 to 3 percent slopes will be added to El Paso County replacing correlated legend map units  107.

National Map unit 2qnms--Olney sandy loam, 0 to 3 percent slopes replaces map units 60 (natsym 3695)in MLRA 69. All original legend map unit symbols will be retained.

National map unit 2qnmv representing Olney sandy loam, 3 to 5 percent slopes will replace existing map unit natsym 3696 in El Paso Counties.  This new map unit will retain the original legend mapunit symbol (61)in El Paso County.

Map unit 2rgqc representing Vonid sandy loam, 0 to 5 percent slopees will replace map unit 104 and 105 in El Paso County MLRA LRU 69B. The new legend map unit symbol will be 117. The original legend map units and DMU's will be retained to represent the Vona soils in MLRA 67B in EL Paso County.",10662,59031

Amendment to:

Classification and Correlation 
of the Soils of
El Paso, Colorado

All of these changes and combinations of map units and symbols are the result of SDJR and on going soil survey update projects.  All have had Quality Control review at the project office and Quality Assurance review at the Regional Office and meet the standards of the National Soil survey Handbook and National Instructions.

National map unit 2rgqk is being established to replace Manvel in Bent, Fremont, El Paso, Pueblo, and Las Animas Counties. The new data map unit updates the Manvel soil to current standards and the soil physical factors and interpretations will be consistent with adjacent surveys. This map unit replaces Manvel only in LRU 69B.


El Paso County will retain the original map unit symbol 50.

All of these changes and combinations of map units and symbols are the result of four projects from the Soil Data Join and Recorrelation Initiative and ongoing soil survey update projects.  All have had Quality Control review at the project office and Quality Assurance review at the Regional Office and meet the standards of the National Soil Survey Handbook and National Instructions.

Some map units are being split based on differences in climatic properties in  different Land Resource Units (LRU) within an MLRA.
