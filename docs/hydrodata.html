<div id="the-hydrodata-object" class="section level2">
<h2>The HydroData object</h2>
<p>All <code>HydroData</code> <strong>find</strong> and <strong>get</strong> functions return objects of class <code>HydroData</code>. This page covers the key components of this class which, at its core, is a list of features related to the query defining the object. All objects range is size from 4 to 9 elements and include (1) metadata (2) data (3) ancillary elements.</p>
<div id="getting-a-hydrodata-object" class="section level3">
<h3>Getting a HydroData Object</h3>
<p>In this example, we query a <code>HydroData</code> object for all USGS stations within a 100 square mile (10 by 10 miles) region centered on UCSB. If you haven’t reviewed how AOI queries are defined I suggest first skimming the <a href="aoi.html">Defining an AOI</a> page.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Query the <code>HydroData</code> Object:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>usgs = findUSGS(clip_unit = list(&quot;UCSB&quot;, 10, 10), basemap = TRUE, boundary = TRUE, ids = T)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="metadata" class="section level3">
<h3>Metadata</h3>
<p>All <code>HydroData</code> objects include core metadata:</p>
<ul>
<li>An AOI Description (<em>default</em>)</li>
<li>The source of the data (<em>default</em>)</li>
<li>A projection CRS object (<em>default</em> if spatial)</li>
<li>A time period (<em>default</em> if Observation)</li>
<li>Parameter list (<em>default</em> if Observation)</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>name</strong> element of a <code>HydroData</code> object contains a plain-English text string describing the location of the AOI.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>usgs$name</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;A 10 mile tall by 10 mile wide region centered on (the)  UCSB&quot;</code></pre>
<p><br></p>
<p>The <strong>source</strong> element contains a text string describing the source of the data.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>usgs$source</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;USGS NWIS&quot;</code></pre>
<p>If the <code>HydroData</code> object contains <code>spatial</code> or <code>raster</code> data, a <strong>proj</strong> element will be added.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>usgs$proj</code></pre>
<pre><code>## CRS arguments:
##  +proj=longlat +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0+no_defs</code></pre>
<p>However, if the <code>HydroData</code> object contains observation data (<code>data.frame</code>), a <strong>timespane</strong> and <strong>param</strong> element will be added detailing the time period and parameters contained in the object.</p>
</div>
<div id="data" class="section level3">
<h3>Data</h3>
<p>The data element holds the actual data queried and can be in the form of a <code>data.frame</code>, <code>sp</code>, or <code>raster</code> object.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>str(usgs$nwis, max = 2)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Formal class &#39;SpatialPointsDataFrame&#39; [package &quot;sp&quot;] with 5 slots

<div id="ancillary-elements" class="section level3">
<h3>Ancillary Elements</h3>
<p>Four ancillary elements can be added to a <code>HydroData</code> query using the optional function parameters thees include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A basemap</li>
<li>An AOI shapefile</li>
<li>A shapefile of intersecting counties</li>
<li>Critical station IDs/names</li>
</ul>
<p>If <code>basemap = TRUE</code> in any function, a basemap will be added to the <code>HydroData</code> object. Four different map types can be added depending on what <code>basemap =</code> is set to.</p>
<ul>
<li>‘t’: a terrain imagery basemap (Default if <code>basemap = TRUE</code>)</li>
<li>‘s’: a satellite imagery basemap (eg <code>basemap = 's'</code>)</li>
<li>‘h’: a hybrid imagery basemap</li>
<li>‘r’: a road map basemap</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>The basemap will be indexed under <strong>basemap</strong> and an example of each type can be seen below:</p>
<p><br> <left> <a ><img alt = '' width='800' src='img/basemaps.png' /></a> </left> <br> <br></p>
<p>If <code>boundary = TRUE</code>, a shapefile of the AOI and a shapefile of the intersecting counties will be added (<em>if differenet</em>). The AOI shapefile is stored under the <strong>boundary</strong> element,</p>

<p>Finally if <code>ids = TRUE</code> then the key identifiers for each element will be stored. For example, in a USGS station <code>HydroData</code> object, the gage IDs will be stored. Primarily this layer is to provide easier access to identifying features for use in <a href="get_tab.html">get observatio function</a>.</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>After understanding what a <code>HydroData</code> object is, and what it can store/query, I suggest checking out how queries can be built for <a href="find.html">Finding Observation Station</a>, <a href="get_tab.html">Getting Observation data</a>, <a href="get_vec.html">Getting Vector data</a>, and <a href="get_rast.html">Getting Raster Data</a>.</p>
